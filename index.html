        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
          This is a website I've made in my free time and if you're here that
          means I've given you a link to it. Otherwise, you're welcome to look
          around, but how the fuck did you get here? In any case, I've seperated
          this site in two sections: one that's safe-for-work and one that's
          not-safe-for-work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SFW section: This contains information about me, about the
          characters I've created over the years and who drew them for me and my
          different media handles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NSFW section: Well, I'm sure you can probably already guess what
          this section's all about. In it there's gonna be my own collection of
          lewd pics and videos and those of girls I found attractive and
          collected pictures of. I'll add more if I want to and if you ask.
